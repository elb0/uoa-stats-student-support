[Instructions in my doc.](https://lizabolton.github.io/uoa-stats-student-support/#discussion-boards)\n:::\n\n# Te Papa Manaki | Campus Care\n\n[Campus Care](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/students/student-support/personal-support/te-papa-manaaki-campus-care.html?_ga=2.180790372.232695089.1686091452-605446100.1683666903) will often be the best option if you are concerned about a student during business hours, but the situation does not appear to warrant a 111 call. They can handle acute concerns (e.g., a student indicates a desire to self-harm on Piazza or via email), as well as less time-sensitive referrals.\n\n# Student advisers\n\nFor less acute situations, you can encourage students to reach out the [student advisers](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/current-students/student-support/advisers-support.html) and/or make a referral, with the student's permission. There is **an adviser for Stats and (at time of writing) a separate adviser for Data Science**. **Lizzie Tafili is the adviser for MƒÅori and Pacific** students (from experience, she is awesome to work with!).\n\n::: callout-tip\nProvide students with a link to the ['Getting support'](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/students/student-support/personal-support/be-well/getting-support.html) hub, or having it linked prominently in your slides/course,¬†\n:::\n\n# How to refer a student?\n\n[![](img/refer.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot from the refer component of the training described later in the document.
