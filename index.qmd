Mental health discussed. Staff members can contact the [Employee Assistance Programme](#0 "https://www.staff.auckland.ac.nz/en/human-resources/staff-support-services/employee-assistance-programme.html") for individual support.

This is not an official Waipapa Taumata Rau University of Auckland resource.

# Emergency

[**If it is an emergency call 111.**]{style="color:red;"} You can then call Campus Security as well on 0800 373 7550 or 966 (internal).

If you do not have enough information to call 111 (i.e., the student is not with you, you do not know where they are), Campus Security can call the listed emergency contact for a student, but be careful about this if it risks putting the student in a more difficult position. For example, if you are somewhat concerned about an email or Piazza/Ed Discussion post that indicates the student is very upset and they say something like "I just want to die" --- having their parents called when they were letting off steam, albeit doing so inappropriately, could make things a lot worse for them.

For the most updated central University emergency contact information: [Contacts and information sources](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/emergency-information/contact-numbers.html).

::: callout-tip
üì± To do: Save Auckland University Security --- 0800 373 7550 --- in your phone.

üí° Adding it to your Contact Favourites and/or having it start with 'A' will put it near the top for easy access.

## Discussion boards

If the concern you're dealing with is based on a post on Ed Discussion or another discussion board you manage, and is currently public, please make the post private to instructors.

# Referring students:

## Main go-to: Te Papa Manaki \| Campus Care

[Link](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/students/student-support/personal-support/te-papa-manaaki-campus-care.html?_ga=2.180790372.232695089.1686091452-605446100.1683666903)

What will often be the best option if you are concerned about a student during business hours (but the situation does not appear to warrant a 111 call) is to reach out to the Campus Care team. They can handle acute concerns (e.g., a student indicates a desire to self-harm in a discussion post or via email), as well as less time-sensitive referrals for issues around:¬†

-   Mental health concerns and support planning

-   Family violence and other safety issues

-   Anxiety and distress issues impacting study¬†¬†

-   Financial concerns and stress¬†

-   Stress related to caring responsibilities¬†¬†¬†¬†

-   Bullying, harassment & discrimination

-   Sexual harm, including sexual harassment and assault¬†

-   For those facing an exceptional circumstance outside of their control, one of the team can work out a support plan with you looking at academic and other needs.

## In-person: Counselling service

If you are present with a student in distress on campus you can go together to the [University Health and Counselling Service](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/students/student-support/personal-support/student-health-counselling.html) in Kate Edger (opening hours [here](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/students/student-support/personal-support/student-health-counselling/contact-university-health-counselling-service.html), usually *at least* 8:30 to 4PM, Monday to Friday, semester breaks may be different) and ask for a counsellor ASAP. You may have to wait with the student for a little but, but this enables you to keep them safe while also moving the responsibility to a trained helper.

*Thank you to Charlotte Jones-Todd for this info!*

## Phone counselling (free for students)

*Online support available seven days a week, 9am-9pm.*

*Get support with feelings of anxiety, low mood, relationships, grief, addictions, low self-esteem or low confidence.*

-   *A phone and online support service to help strengthen your wellbeing.*

-   *Counselling sessions are held over the phone and use a web-based program.*

-   *The service is independent, confidential and free.*

*To enrol, call 0800 782 999 or click the link below.*

*Please note: you will be asked for your student ID number to confirm you are an enrolled student.*

## For less acute situations & general pastoral care

You can encourage students to reach out the [student advisers](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/current-students/student-support/advisers-support.html) to book an appointment and/or make a referral, with the student's permission.

Writing as of Feb 2025, the adviser website has changed and no longer shows the advisers for each subject and identity and instead there is a general inbox to reach out to. Unfortunately, this team has lost some members (including the amazing Emma who some of you will have met at a 2024 department meeting) and is now a bit short-staffed.

::: callout-tip
Provide students with a link to the ['Getting support'](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/students/student-support/personal-support/be-well/getting-support.html) hub, or having it linked prominently in your slides/course,¬†

# Training options (staff)

Want to feel a bit more confident about handling wellbeing situations with students? I'd really recommend the [Building Connections --- Our role in supporting student wellbeing and safety](https://uoa.csod.com/ui/lms-learning-details/app/course/3392b03e-bf8a-441e-b38f-28448f7cecad?isCompletionRedirect=true&loStatus=16&regnum=1&loId=3392b03e-bf8a-441e-b38f-28448f7cecad) training available to all staff. It is tailored to UoA, and while some if it will seem obvious or straightforward, there are also lots of great reminders, resource overviews and tips. Takes \~30 minutes, self-paced.
