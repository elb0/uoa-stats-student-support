# In an emergency

[**If it is an emergency call 111.**]{style="color:red;"} You can then call Campus Security as well on 0800 373 7550 or 966 (internal).

# It ... might? ... be an emergency?

If you do not have enough information to call 111 (i.e., the student is not with you, you do not know where they are), Campus Security can call the listed emergency contact for a student.

Be careful about this if it risks putting the student in a more difficult position. 

For example, if you are somewhat concerned about an email or Piazza/Ed Discussion post that indicates the student is very upset and they say something like "I just want to die" --- having their parents called when they were letting off steam, albeit doing so inappropriately, could make things a lot worse for them.

Make sure you know how to make posts private on the discussion board you use. [Instructions in my doc.](https://lizabolton.github.io/uoa-stats-student-support/#discussion-boards)

# Te Papa Manaki | Campus Care

[Campus Care](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/students/student-support/personal-support/te-papa-manaaki-campus-care.html?_ga=2.180790372.232695089.1686091452-605446100.1683666903) will often be the best option if you are concerned about a student during business hours, but the situation does not appear to warrant a 111 call. They can handle acute concerns (e.g., a student indicates a desire to self-harm on Piazza or via email), as well as less time-sensitive referrals.

# Student advisers

For less acute situations, you can encourage students to reach out the [student advisers](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/current-students/student-support/advisers-support.html) and/or make a referral, with the student's permission. There is **an adviser for Stats and (at time of writing) a separate adviser for Data Science**. **Lizzie Tafili is the adviser for MƒÅori and Pacific** students (from experience, she is awesome to work with!).

::: callout-tip
Provide students with a link to the ['Getting support'](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/students/student-support/personal-support/be-well/getting-support.html) hub, or having it linked prominently in your slides/course,¬†

# How to refer a student?

# Whai Ora | Be Well

*"Be Well offers a range of tools and information to help you care for your physical, emotional and spiritual wellbeing, so you can thrive."*

This is a great portal for general information for your students, especially about ways for them to improve their skills/knowledge/wellness etc. outside times of acute distress or struggle.
